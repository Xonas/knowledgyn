"a good memory is a balance between remembering and forgetting. If we were we to improve it, 
we might then have difficulty forgetting all the trivial things that happened during the day that there is no need to remember. 
The ‘yin and yang’ of a good memory is one that remembers and organizes the right things in the brain, 
but forgets things that seem less important. 
It seems unlikely that we shall ever have a pill that will act like a magic bullet to improve memory, 
at least in normal people. Evolution has ensured that the system is optimally balanced.”

"Había aprendido sin esfuerzo el inglés, el francés, el portugués, el latín. 
Sospecho, sin embargo, que no era muy capaz de pensar. Pensar es olvidar diferencias, es generalizar, abstraer. 
En el abarrotado mundo de Funes no había sino detalles, casi inmediatos.”
